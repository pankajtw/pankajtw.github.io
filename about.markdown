Hey there! I’m Pankaj — a backend and infrastructure engineer with over 10 years of experience working with databases, cloud platforms, and modern system architectures. I’ve spent a good part of my career digging deep into MySQL internals, setting up complex replication topologies, automating backups, and solving real-world performance bottlenecks. I enjoy building scalable, fault-tolerant systems and have a strong interest in event-driven architectures, CI/CD, and open-source tools. This blog is my space to document what I learn, break down tricky concepts, and share practical guides — from managing production databases to deploying sleek apps on the cloud. If you're into clean infrastructure, resilient systems, and the occasional debugging war story, you’re in the right place.
